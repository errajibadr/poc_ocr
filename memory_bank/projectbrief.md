# OCR Proof of Concept Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Proof of Concept (POC) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. The purpose is to explore and evaluate different OCR methods, create a testing dataset, and benchmark various OCR techniques to determine the most effective solutions currently available.

## Project Goals
1. Create a comprehensive test dataset for OCR evaluation
2. Research and identify the latest and most effective OCR methods
3. Implement and test multiple OCR techniques
4. Compare and analyze the results to determine optimal approaches

## Success Criteria
- Successfully compile a diverse and representative test dataset
- Identify at least 3-5 modern OCR techniques for evaluation
- Successfully implement and test each technique
- Produce comparative analysis of technique effectiveness
- Document findings and recommendations

## Timeline
To be determined during PLAN phase
