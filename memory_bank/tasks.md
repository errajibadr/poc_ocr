# OCR POC Project Tasks

## Task Tracking

### Task 1: Create a Test Dataset for OCR
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Description**: Compile a comprehensive test dataset for OCR evaluation by searching the internet for suitable resources.
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Research available OCR datasets
  - [ ] Identify criteria for dataset selection (language variety, document types, quality levels)
  - [ ] Collect sample documents/images with known text content
  - [ ] Prepare ground truth transcriptions for evaluation
  - [ ] Organize dataset into categories for testing different aspects of OCR
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Assignee**: TBD
- **Notes**: Consider including various document types, languages, fonts, and image qualities

### Task 2: Research OCR Methods
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Description**: Research and identify the best and most recent OCR methods and technologies available.
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Conduct literature review of current OCR technologies
  - [ ] Identify leading open-source OCR libraries and frameworks
  - [ ] Research commercial OCR solutions and APIs
  - [ ] Compare features, capabilities, and limitations of each method
  - [ ] Create shortlist of technologies to test
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Assignee**: TBD
- **Notes**: Focus on both traditional and modern deep learning-based approaches

### Task 3: Test OCR Techniques
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Description**: Implement and test various OCR techniques identified in Task 2.
- **Subtasks**:
  - [ ] Set up testing environment for OCR evaluation
  - [ ] Implement integration with selected OCR libraries/APIs
  - [ ] Develop evaluation metrics and benchmarking methodology
  - [ ] Run tests on the compiled dataset
  - [ ] Analyze and compare results
