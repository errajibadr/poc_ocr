# OCR POC Project Progress

## Overall Status
Phase 2: Research and Data Preparation - In Progress

## Completed Tasks
- Created memory bank structure
- Initialized project documentation
- Comprehensive task planning completed
- Project setup and environment configuration (Task 1)
- Architecture design decisions documented (Task 2, major components)

## In Progress
- Finalizing Task 2: System Architecture Design (Creative Phase)
- Planning for Task 3: Create Test Dataset for OCR
- Planning for Task 4: Research OCR Methods

## Pending Tasks
- Task 5: Creative Phase - Evaluation Framework Design
- Task 6: Implement Evaluation Framework
- Task 7: Test OCR Techniques
- Task 8: Documentation and Reporting

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Setup and Preparation (Task 1) - âœ… COMPLETED
- **Phase 2**: Research and Data Preparation (Tasks 2-5) - ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- **Phase 3**: Implementation and Testing (Tasks 6-7)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and Finalization (Task 8)

## Timeline
- Project initialization: Completed
- Planning phase: Completed
- Implementation Phase 1 (Setup): Completed
- Creative phases: Architecture design nearly complete
- Implementation Phase 2-4: Not started
- Documentation phase: Not started

## Issues/Risks
- None identified at this stage

## Next Actions
- Complete review of architecture design
- Begin dataset preparation and research tasks in parallel
- Prepare for implementation of core components
- Define interfaces between system components in detail
- Create plugin mechanism for OCR engines

## [2023-11-18]: Project Setup Completed
- **Files Created**: 
  - Project structure with modular organization
  - Configuration system with Pydantic
  - Base OCR engine interface with plugin registry
  - Dataset handling modules
  - Evaluation metrics and visualization
  - Logging configuration
  - Documentation and tests
- **Key Changes**: 
  - Implemented Strategy Pattern for OCR engines
  - Created modular architecture for dataset management
  - Implemented metrics for OCR evaluation
  - Set up visualization tools for results comparison
- **Testing**: Basic test structure in place
- **Next Steps**: System architecture design in CREATIVE mode

## [Current Date]: Architecture Design Completed
- **Design Decisions**:
  - Selected Modular Hub-and-Spoke Architecture after evaluating three approaches
  - Defined five core components: Orchestrator, Dataset Manager, OCR Engine Registry, Evaluation Manager, Visualization Service
  - Created component and sequence diagrams for visualization
  - Established clear data flow between components
  - Defined implementation guidelines for interfaces, plugin system, configuration, error handling, and testing
- **Key Benefits**:
  - Flexible design allows easy addition of new OCR engines
  - Central coordination simplifies workflow management
  - Clear component boundaries and responsibilities
  - Builds on existing code structure and patterns
  - Balances flexibility with reasonable implementation complexity
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive architecture document at memory_bank/architecture_design.md
- **Next Steps**: Review architecture design and prepare for implementation
