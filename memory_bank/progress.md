# OCR POC Project Progress

## Overall Status
Implementation Phase (BUILD Mode) - Phase 1 Completed

## Completed Tasks
- Created memory bank structure
- Initialized project documentation
- Comprehensive task planning completed
- Project setup and environment configuration (Task 1)

## In Progress
- None (awaiting transition to CREATIVE mode for Task 2)

## Pending Tasks
- Creative Phase - System Architecture Design
- Create a test dataset for OCR evaluation
- Research different OCR methods
- Creative Phase - Evaluation Framework Design
- Implement Evaluation Framework
- Test OCR Techniques
- Documentation and Reporting

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Setup and Preparation (Task 1) - âœ… COMPLETED
- **Phase 2**: Research and Data Preparation (Tasks 3-5)
- **Phase 3**: Implementation and Testing (Tasks 6-7)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and Finalization (Task 8)

## Timeline
- Project initialization: Completed
- Planning phase: Completed
- Implementation Phase 1 (Setup): Completed
- Creative phases: Not started
- Implementation Phase 2-4: Not started
