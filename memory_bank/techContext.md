# OCR Technical Context

## OCR Technology Landscape

### Traditional OCR Approaches
- **Pattern Matching**: Compares character images against a stored library of character templates
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifies characteristic features of each character (lines, curves, etc.)
- **Matrix Matching**: Compares characters pixel by pixel with a stored glyph representation
- **Rule-based systems**: Uses predetermined rules for character recognition

### Modern OCR Approaches
- **Deep Learning Models**: CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers for image processing and text recognition
- **End-to-end OCR**: Single neural network pipeline from image to text
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus on relevant parts of the image during recognition
- **Language Models**: Post-processing with language models to improve accuracy

## Potential Technologies to Evaluate

### Libraries and Frameworks
- **Tesseract OCR**: Open-source OCR engine developed by Google
- **EasyOCR**: Python library for OCR with deep learning models
- **PaddleOCR**: Multilingual, practical OCR system developed by Baidu
- **OCR.Space API**: Cloud-based OCR API
- **Amazon Textract**: AWS service for document text extraction
- **Google Cloud Vision OCR**: Google's OCR offering
- **Microsoft Azure Computer Vision**: Microsoft's OCR service
- **Keras-OCR**: End-to-end OCR pipeline using deep learning

### Development Tools and Languages
- **Python**: Primary development language for many OCR libraries
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for image preprocessing
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: Deep learning frameworks for custom OCR models
- **NLTK/spaCy**: Natural language processing for post-processing
