# OCR POC Active Context

## Current Phase
Project Initialization (VAN Mode)

## Current Focus
- Setting up project structure
- Defining scope and objectives
- Preparing for detailed planning

## Active Tasks
1. Create a test dataset for OCR evaluation
2. Research different OCR methods (best and most recent)
3. Test various OCR techniques

## Next Steps
- Transition to PLAN mode to develop a comprehensive project plan
- Detail the approach for dataset creation
- Identify specific OCR technologies to evaluate
- Define evaluation metrics and testing methodology

## Blockers
- None at this stage

## Notes
- This is a Level 3 complexity task requiring PLAN mode
- Need to determine specific OCR libraries and frameworks to test
- Need to decide on dataset characteristics (language, document types, complexity levels)
- Should consider both open-source and commercial OCR solutions
