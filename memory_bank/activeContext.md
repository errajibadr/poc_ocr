# OCR POC Active Context

## Current Phase
Implementation Phase 1 Completed - Ready for Creative Phase

## Current Focus
- Completed project setup and environment configuration
- Ready to begin system architecture design
- Established modular codebase structure
- Implemented core modules with plugin architecture

## Active Tasks
1. ✅ Project Setup and Environment Configuration (Task 1) - COMPLETED
2. ⏭️ Creative Phase - System Architecture Design (Task 2) - NEXT FOCUS
3. Create a test dataset for OCR evaluation
4. Research different OCR methods
5. Creative Phase - Evaluation Framework Design
6. Implement Evaluation Framework
7. Test OCR Techniques
8. Documentation and Reporting

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Setup and Preparation (Task 1) - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Phase 2**: Research and Data Preparation (Tasks 3-5)
- **Phase 3**: Implementation and Testing (Tasks 6-7)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and Finalization (Task 8)

## Creative Phases Needed
- System Architecture Design (Task 2) - NEXT STEP
- Evaluation Framework Design (Task 5)

## Next Steps
- Transition to CREATIVE mode for system architecture design
- Define the overall architecture for the OCR testing framework
- Design component interfaces following Strategy Pattern
- Document architecture decisions

## Key Components Implemented
- Base OCR engine interface with plugin registry
- Dataset management system
- Evaluation metrics framework
- Configuration system with Pydantic
- Logging setup with loguru
- Visualization utilities for OCR results

## Blockers
- None at this stage

## Notes
- The project follows a Level 3 complexity approach
- System has modular design to allow different OCR engines
- Core infrastructure is in place and ready for architecture design
- All base libraries installed and configured
- Test structure set up with pytest
