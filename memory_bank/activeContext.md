# OCR POC Active Context

## Current Phase
Phase 2: Research and Data Preparation - In Progress

## Current Focus
- Architecture design completed with Modular Hub-and-Spoke approach
- Ready for final review of architecture design
- Planning dataset preparation for OCR testing
- Researching OCR methods and technologies

## Active Tasks
1. ‚úÖ Project Setup and Environment Configuration (Task 1) - COMPLETED
2. üîÑ Creative Phase - System Architecture Design (Task 2) - IN PROGRESS
3. üìã Create a test dataset for OCR evaluation (Task 3) - PLANNING
4. üîç Research different OCR methods (Task 4) - PLANNING
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Creative Phase - Evaluation Framework Design (Task 5) - PENDING
6. ‚è≠Ô∏è Implement Evaluation Framework (Task 6) - PENDING
7. ‚è≠Ô∏è Test OCR Techniques (Task 7) - PENDING
8. ‚è≠Ô∏è Documentation and Reporting (Task 8) - PENDING

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Setup and Preparation (Task 1) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Phase 2**: Research and Data Preparation (Tasks 2-5) - üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- **Phase 3**: Implementation and Testing (Tasks 6-7)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and Finalization (Task 8)

## Creative Phases Needed
- System Architecture Design (Task 2) - üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Major design decisions completed)
- Evaluation Framework Design (Task 5) - ‚è≠Ô∏è PENDING

## Next Steps
1. Finalize architecture design:
   - Review all component interfaces
   - Validate against requirements
   - Prepare for implementation

2. Prepare for dataset creation (Task 3):
   - Research available OCR datasets
   - Define requirements for test dataset
   - Plan collection and preprocessing approach

3. Start OCR methods research (Task 4):
   - Review traditional and modern OCR approaches
   - Evaluate available libraries and APIs
   - Identify promising methods for testing

## Key Decisions Made
- Selected Modular Hub-and-Spoke Architecture for system design
- Defined five core components: Orchestrator, Dataset Manager, OCR Engine Registry, Evaluation Manager, Visualization Service
- Established clear data flow between components
- Documented detailed implementation guidelines
- Created component and sequence diagrams

## Key Components Implemented
- Base OCR engine interface with plugin registry
- Dataset management system
- Evaluation metrics framework
- Configuration system with Pydantic
- Logging setup with loguru
- Visualization utilities for OCR results

## Blockers
- None at this stage

## Notes
- The project follows a Level 3 complexity approach
- System has modular design to allow different OCR engines
- Core infrastructure is in place and ready for architecture refinement
- All base libraries installed and configured
- Test structure set up with pytest
- Architecture design documented in memory_bank/architecture_design.md
