# OCR POC Active Context

## Current Phase
Project Planning (PLAN Mode)

## Current Focus
- Developing detailed implementation plan
- Defining comprehensive tasks and subtasks
- Preparing for system architecture design
- Establishing implementation strategy

## Active Tasks
1. Project Setup and Environment Configuration
2. Creative Phase - System Architecture Design
3. Create a test dataset for OCR evaluation
4. Research different OCR methods (best and most recent)
5. Creative Phase - Evaluation Framework Design
6. Implement Evaluation Framework
7. Test OCR Techniques
8. Documentation and Reporting

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Setup and Preparation (Tasks 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Research and Data Preparation (Tasks 3-5)
- **Phase 3**: Implementation and Testing (Tasks 6-7)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and Finalization (Task 8)

## Creative Phases Needed
- System Architecture Design (Task 2)
- Evaluation Framework Design (Task 5)

## Next Steps
- Transition to CREATIVE mode for architecture design
- Design modular system architecture
- Define interfaces between system components
- Create plugin mechanism for OCR engines

## Blockers
- None at this stage

## Notes
- The project follows a Level 3 complexity approach
- System requires modular design to allow different OCR engines
- Focus on Python development with uv for package management
- Implementation will follow Strategy Pattern for OCR engines
- Need to ensure comprehensive dataset for proper evaluation
