# Task 3: Create Test Dataset for OCR - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for Task 3: Create Test Dataset for OCR. The goal is to compile a comprehensive test dataset for OCR evaluation by researching available resources, defining requirements, collecting samples, and organizing them in a structured way.

## 1. Research & Requirements Phase

### 1.1 Research Available OCR Datasets
- Research academic OCR datasets:
  - ICDAR competitions datasets (document analysis and recognition)
  - IAM Handwriting Database (handwritten text)
  - PRImA dataset (layout analysis)
  - UW3 and UNLV datasets (document understanding)
  - MNIST/SVHN (for digit recognition)
- Research open-source datasets:
  - Google's SynthText (synthetic text in natural images)
  - COCO-Text (text in natural images)
  - PubLayNet (scientific publication layout)
  - DocVQA (document visual question answering)
  - HierText (hierarchical text recognition)
- Document each dataset's:
  - Content type and diversity
  - Size and format
  - Licensing and usage restrictions
  - Ground truth formats and quality
  - Accessibility (download methods)

### 1.2 Define Dataset Requirements
- Define dataset diversity requirements across multiple dimensions:
  - **Language diversity**: Multiple languages with different scripts
    - Latin-based: English, French, Spanish, etc.
    - Non-Latin: Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Cyrillic, etc.
  - **Document types**:
    - Printed text (books, articles)
    - Forms and structured documents
    - Invoices and receipts
    - Business cards
    - Handwritten notes
  - **Quality variations**:
    - Clean scans (high resolution)
    - Noisy images
    - Different lighting conditions
    - Various resolutions
    - Different compression artifacts
  - **Text variations**:
    - Font types and families
    - Font sizes and styles (bold, italic)
    - Text density and spacing
  - **Layout complexity**:
    - Simple paragraphs
    - Multi-column text
    - Tables and forms
    - Text with images
  - **Special cases**:
    - Mathematical formulas
    - Charts and diagrams with text
    - Stamps and logos with text
- Create a standardized metadata schema for dataset samples

## 2. Tools Development Phase

### 2.1 Dataset Utility Development
- Create a `dataset_utils.py` module with the following components:
  - **Dataset Downloader**:
    - Functions to download datasets from various sources
    - Support for different download methods (direct, API)
    - Download verification (checksums, file integrity)
    - Archive extraction utilities
  - **Format Converter**:
    - Parsers for different ground truth formats (XML, JSON, text)
    - Text and bounding box extraction utilities
    - Standardized output format generator
  - **Data Augmentation**:
    - Image preprocessing utilities (resize, crop, normalize)
    - Noise addition functions (Gaussian, salt-pepper, etc.)
    - Geometric transformations (rotation, perspective, etc.)
    - Lighting and contrast adjustment
  - **Dataset Inspector**:
    - Statistics generator for datasets
    - Sample visualization with ground truth overlay
    - Validation functions for data integrity

### 2.2 Testing Utilities
- Create and test each utility with sample data
- Write unit tests for critical functions
- Document usage examples for each utility

## 3. Dataset Collection & Processing Phase

### 3.1 Public Dataset Processing
- Download selected public datasets
- Process each dataset:
  - Extract relevant samples
  - Convert ground truth to standardized format
  - Generate metadata according to schema
  - Organize into appropriate categories

### 3.2 Custom Dataset Creation
- Identify gaps in available datasets
- Create additional samples for underrepresented categories:
  - Generate synthetic samples if needed
  - Create specialized test cases for edge conditions
  - Include samples with known OCR challenges

### 3.3 Data Augmentation
- Apply preprocessing to create variations:
  - Generate quality variants (noise, blur, etc.)
  - Create lighting and perspective variations
  - Add realistic distortions and artifacts

### 3.4 Organization
- Organize processed data into standardized directory structure:
  - Categorize by document type, language, and quality
  - Create consistent naming conventions
  - Implement dataset versioning

## 4. Documentation & Validation Phase

### 4.1 Dataset Documentation
- Create comprehensive documentation:
  - Dataset overview and statistics
  - Category descriptions and sample counts
  - Source attributions and licenses
  - Usage instructions for the OCR POC system

### 4.2 Dataset Validation
- Verify dataset completeness:
  - Check all required categories have sufficient samples
  - Ensure metadata consistency
  - Validate ground truth accuracy
- Generate dataset statistics and visualizations
- Test dataset loading with existing OCRDataset class

## 5. Integration with Project Infrastructure

### 5.1 Dataset Loading
- Ensure compatibility with existing dataset classes
- Test loading and preprocessing pipeline
- Create example scripts for dataset usage

### 5.2 Final Review
- Review entire dataset for quality and completeness
- Generate final statistics and report
- Document any known limitations or biases

## Timeline and Dependencies
- **Phase 1**: Research & Requirements (2-3 days)
- **Phase 2**: Tools Development (2-3 days)
- **Phase 3**: Dataset Collection & Processing (3-4 days)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation & Validation (1-2 days)
- **Total Estimated Time**: 8-12 days

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive, well-organized OCR test dataset
- Documentation of dataset characteristics and organization
- Utilities for dataset management and augmentation
- Integration with existing project infrastructure
