## Dependencies and Integration Points

### Key Dependencies
- Task 2 (Architecture) must be completed before Task 5 (Evaluation Framework Design)
- Tasks 3 and 4 can proceed in parallel
- Task 5 requires input from Tasks 3 and 4 to be complete

### Integration Considerations
- Ensure dataset design (Task 3) aligns with architecture (Task 2)
- OCR methods research (Task 4) should inform architecture decisions (Task 2)
- Evaluation framework design (Task 5) must accommodate all OCR methods from Task 4

## Challenges and Mitigations

### Challenges
1. **Dataset Diversity and Scope**
   - Risk: Dataset may not cover sufficient diversity of documents
   - Mitigation: Define clear categories and ensure representation across all types

2. **OCR Technology Landscape**
   - Risk: Rapidly evolving field may make research quickly outdated
   - Mitigation: Focus on fundamental capabilities and adaptability rather than specific implementations

3. **Architecture Complexity**
   - Risk: Over-engineering the system architecture
   - Mitigation: Regularly validate against use cases and keep design modular but minimal

4. **Evaluation Framework Bias**
   - Risk: Evaluation metrics may favor certain approaches
   - Mitigation: Design multiple complementary metrics and validate against diverse document types
