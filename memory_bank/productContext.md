# OCR Product Context

## What is OCR?
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that enables the conversion of different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. OCR technology identifies text within an image, then translates the identified characters into a machine-readable format.

## Use Cases
- Document digitization and archiving
- Data extraction from forms and receipts
- Automated data entry
- Text extraction from images for search and indexing
- Accessibility tools for visually impaired users
- License plate recognition
- Passport and ID document processing
- Converting printed books to digital formats

## Market Context
OCR technology has evolved significantly in recent years with the advancement of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Traditional rule-based OCR systems are increasingly being replaced or enhanced by neural network approaches, which offer improved accuracy, especially for complex documents, multiple languages, and challenging visual conditions.

## Challenges
- Handling varied fonts and styles
- Processing low-quality images
- Recognizing handwritten text
- Managing document layouts and structures
- Supporting multiple languages
- Dealing with special characters and symbols
- Processing documents with poor lighting or distortion

## Evaluation Metrics
- Character accuracy
- Word accuracy
- Processing time
- Language support
- Layout retention capability
- Handling of special formatting
